MENTAL HEALTH CHATBOT
This repository contains the code for a basic mental health chatbot designed to understand and respond to user inputs regarding their mental health. The chatbot utilizes natural language processing (NLP) and a neural network model to classify user intents and generate appropriate responses.

Features
Natural Language Understanding (NLU): Tokenizes and processes user input to understand their intent.
Intent Classification: Uses a neural network model to classify user input into predefined categories such as greetings, expressions of depression, and suicidal thoughts.
Response Generation: Provides appropriate responses based on the classified intent.
Continuous Learning: Logs user interactions to allow for periodic retraining of the model, improving its performance over time.
Libraries Used
numpy: For numerical operations and data manipulation.
tensorflow: For building and training the neural network model.
nltk: For natural language processing tasks such as tokenization.
scikit-learn: For label encoding and splitting the dataset into training and test sets.
Installation
To run this project, you need to install the required libraries. You can install them using the following pip commands:

sh
Copy code
pip install numpy tensorflow nltk scikit-learn
Usage
Prepare the Data: The chatbot uses a simple dataset of intents and responses. Modify the data.json file to add or update intents and responses.
Train the Model: Run the code to preprocess the data and train the neural network model.
Interact with the Chatbot: Use the chatbot in an interactive loop to enter user inputs and receive responses.
Example
python
Copy code
# Example usage of the chatbot
while True:
    user_input = input("You: ")
    if user_input.lower() in ["exit", "quit"]:
        break
    response = chatbot_response(user_input)
    print(f"Bot: {response}")
Continuous Improvement
The chatbot logs user interactions to chatbot.log for continuous learning. This log can be used to retrain the model periodically, ensuring the chatbot improves over time.

Notes
This is a basic implementation intended for educational purposes. A real-world mental health chatbot should involve domain experts, comply with data privacy regulations, and include mechanisms for handling crises, such as immediate referral to professional help.
